# Radio Communication Basics

## 1. Introduction

This chapter cover the use of radio and contain all information you should need to properly operate your radio during an operation.

The goal is to allow you to get a quick understanding of what we expect regarding the use of radio and how you should communicate with your fellow members. Good communication is a very important part of any operation as it will greatly improve the experience of everyone involved.

## 4. Radio Operator

The Radio Operator (RTO) is the link between the Commander and all other elements. His role is to monitor all relevant radio channels and to relay communications between the different elements and to transmit the commander orders.

To achieve this, the RTO is expected to carry as many radios as necessary. For example, For one Section (like wolfpack) and one artillery battery (hammer), the RTO loadout would be :

- 2 x 343 
  - 1 for the command squad the RTO is part of
  - 1 for any squad the RTO may need to contact or attach himself to
- 3 x 152
  - 1 for radio channel to contact Command Team (Crossroads)
  - 1 for radio channel to contact the section elements (wolfpack)
  - 1 for radio channel to contact the artilery element (hammer)


More radios may be required to cover all the channels depending on the elements present during an operation. The use of a 117 may be required for elements operating farther away.

During an operation, you will have to switch your PTT between the different radios to talk on the different radio channels (you will always hear from all the radios even those you are not speaking into). You can for example set your radios as follow :
- PTT 1 : 343 radios
- PTT 2 : 152 radios 
- PTT 3 : 117 radios

When switching between active radios, you will just have to set the PTT using ACE interact.
