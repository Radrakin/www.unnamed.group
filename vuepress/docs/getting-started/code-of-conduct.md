# Code of Conduct

The most important thing you must know and agree to in order to be in UAG is our **Code of Conduct**. The rules in this document must be followed by all members of UAG in order to maintain a fun and non-hostile environment for everyone. Failure to follow any of these rules may result in a discussion between all other members regarding the incident, and after a vote is tallied, could potentially end with the termination of a membership with the group.

## 1. Don't be a Cunt

This rule should be pretty straightforward, but some still slip up on this one. We are here to have a good time with friends, not to be bullied harassed by people online. There is a lot of "banter" in the group, as that's the environment we enjoy the most, but sometimes people can take it too far and in those cases we crack down hard on those who ignore multiple warnings to stop.

Here are some brief examples of what we're talking about:

- If you're told to stop, fucking stop. Don't take it as an insult, just drop it and move on.
- Do not bring people's families into things in a malicious manner, keep shit civil.
- Do not make memes of others in poor taste, we have a lot of inside jokes but doing it for insidious reasons is just fucked.
- Doing shit for the sole purpose of "being edgy" is just stupid, stop it, get some help.

## 2. Buddy Teams

When playing in-game we assign people together in teams of two, usually in complimentary pairs to increase combat effectiveness. We require that all players stick with their buddy no matter what, this allows us to maintain a much more firm condition of situational awareness and saves contractors' lives every session. Your buddy is your responsibility, and your buddy team itself is the responsibility of the team leader. Never give them up, never let them down, never desert them.

## 3. Discord Guidelines

We use Discord outside of sessions to coordinate and communicate with everyone much easier than the Steam or TeamSpeak-only alternatives. By using Discord, you already agree to following the [guidelines](https://discordapp.com/guidelines), so as a unit hosted primarily on Discord we expect everyone to follow these guidelines by default.

## 4. Banned Memes

In order to maintain the sanity of all that shitpost in the UAG Discord, we have some **banned memes** that all users are not permitted to post in any text channel. DMs are non-policable, this only applies to the Official Discord's channels!

The banned memes, and all other sub-meme variants of said memes, are as follows:

- "They did surgery on a grape"

## 5. Third-Party Advertisement

"Third-party" refers specifically to other units or communities that you are personally involved with. Referential language when talking about other communities is tolerated for obvious reasons, but any discussions about other groups is frowned upon in official UAG communication channels.

### 5a. Member "Poaching"

This is obviously strictly prohibited under any circumstances unless authorized by Cody himself, and will usually end in a ban of some sort for those involved.

## 6. Regarding Streamers

### 6a. Streaming Rules

This list of rules applies to anyone who wishes to stream our Arma 3 content or use our communication channels (such as Discord or TeamSpeak) whilst streaming.

In order to stream with/for us, you agree to:

1. Take action to notify those who are playing with you or are in your voice channel that they are on stream.
2. Avoid streaming any disciplinary actions that may be enacted during gameplay.
3. Never share personal information of those in the unit, or stream their face without permission.
4. Only use official UAG media, such as logos, screenshots, videos, or other streams, with express permission by Cody or an officer.

### 6b. Streamer-Friendly Environments

There are some areas of our communications channels where streamers may be using platforms (such as Twitch) that do not allow some words to be said. These areas are to be respected at all times and any violation or failure to respect this rule may end with immediate membership termination.

#### 6b1. List of Stream-Safe Areas

- Any channel in the Discord under the "Streamer Area" channel category
- The entire TeamSpeak server (this includes in-game TFAR/ACRE channels!)

## 7. Can't Attend? Tell Us!

If you cant attend a session please contact one of the "helpers" on discord or steam and let them know 24 hours in advance. Note that currently **Loonah** handles attendance for all members and shinies; she should be your first-contact for these matters.

## 69. Don't Listen to Collin

Seriously, he's fucking retarded. Why do you guys keep listening to him like he even has a right to an opinion?

## 71. Sammy is not cool.
