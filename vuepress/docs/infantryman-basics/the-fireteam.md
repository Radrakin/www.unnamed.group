# The Fireteam

The fireteam is the core component of our infantry sections. Consisting of a maximum of only six members, fireteams are designed to operate using small-team tactics to achieve individual objectives set by the fireteam leader, commonly referred to as the "Actual" of the team. The fireteam leader is also responsible for reporting to the command team that is in charge of the section as a whole, a section being a collection of fireteams that work together to achieve some sort of higher objective.
