# Handbook Start

Welcome to the official UAG handbook! Here you will find everything UAG-related that we could be bothered to write down.

The handbook is organised into three main parts:

- ["Getting Started"](/getting-started/code-of-conduct.md): **New to the unit?** Start here! This section provides critical information for all members to know in order to properly enjoy the unit.
- ["The Unit"](/the-unit/unit-organisation.md): **Want to learn more about how we run UAG?** All of our unit-level operational systems and structure is here, probably not important for anyone outside of staff.
- ["TTP"](/ttp/): This stands for **"Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures,"** which is a phrase pulled from Dslyecxi's Arma guides of the same namesake. This section of the handbook is dedicated to "technical" write-ups of general combat skills and specific-case protocols.

Oh, and if you see anything wrong with this handbook, feel free to correct it! At the bottom of every page on this site is a link to the GitLab repository where all of the source code is open and available to improve.
