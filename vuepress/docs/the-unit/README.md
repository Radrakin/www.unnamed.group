# Unnamed Arma Group

## Introduction

Unnamed Arma Group is a military simulation group that doesn't engage in the drama-inducing and power-tripping bullshit that plagues every other group. We do not conform to any one doctrine, or try to play arm-chair veterans, we are simply just a bunch of friends who love playing Arma!

### Core Values

Our core values dictate how we run the unit and all of it's operations. From gameplay and leadership to mission making and conflict resolution, we strive to implement our core values wherever we can to ensure all have a unified great Arma experience.

**Our core values are:**

1. Be respectful, but not pandering.
2. Be truthful, but not callous.
3. Be right, but not arrogant.
4. Be content, but not oblivious.
5. Be innovative, but not reckless.
